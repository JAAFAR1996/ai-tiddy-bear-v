# ==========================================
# PRODUCTION TUNING NOTES
# ==========================================
# 
# 1. Thresholds based on:
#    - Load testing at 10x expected traffic
#    - P95/P99 baseline measurements
#    - Child psychology research (attention spans)
#    - COPPA legal requirements
#
# 2. False positive reduction:
#    - Deployment windows excluded (using maintenance_mode label)
#    - Gradual threshold increases during scaling events
#    - Context-aware alerts (weekend vs weekday patterns)
#
# 3. Alert fatigue prevention:
#    - Smart grouping by service/team
#    - Escalation delays prevent notification storms  
#    - Auto-resolution when metrics return to normal
#
# 4. Child safety prioritization:
#    - Zero-delay alerts for safety violations
#    - Automatic user blocking for predatory behavior
#    - Compliance team immediate notification for COPPA issues
